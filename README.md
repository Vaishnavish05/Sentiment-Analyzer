# Sentiment Analyzer 

A machine learning-based sentiment analysis system designed to classify text into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** categories. This project implements classical NLP preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and is capable of batch prediction and real-time sentiment inference.

## üìå Project Overview

This sentiment analysis pipeline is built to process raw text, clean and normalize it using NLTK, extract features using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer, and classify the sentiment using multiple supervised learning models.

The final deployed model‚Äî**Random Forest with TF-IDF**‚Äîachieved a validation accuracy of **~70.37%**, demonstrating reliable performance on multi-class sentiment prediction.

## üßæ Dataset

- **Training samples:** 27,481 rows
- **Test samples:** 4,815 rows  
- **Columns include:**
  - `textID`, `text`, `sentiment` (target)
  - Additional metadata: timestamp, country, age, population density, etc.

> Note: The dataset includes some missing values and a large `.csv` file which has been excluded from version control for compliance with GitHub file size limits.
